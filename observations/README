The order of scripts to run to go fram just fits files to
a plotted light curve is:

remove_bias.py     to convert fits files to numpy arrays
make_plots.py      to make the plots and sort through to remove clouds
removeClouds.py    makes removeClouds.sh which removes all fits and numpy
                   files that don't have a corresponding png file
getlightcurve.py   tracks our star and a control star as they drift across
                   the images and outouts a 3 column list of file numbers (time)
		   and fluxex. MUST BE RUN WITH SYNTAX
		   
		       python getlightcurve.py -> fluxes.txt
		       
plotlightcurve.py  corrects for airmass changes in our star using the flux
                   changes in the control star and plots the lightcurve
